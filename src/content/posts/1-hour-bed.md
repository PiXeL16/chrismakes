We needed a bed in a rush for a family member. The entire project from idea to end took 1 day.

The plans were adapted from the simple but functional [Platform Bed](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/essential-platform-bed-frame) project from Ana White.

This bed serves as a comfortable single bed of approximately 2 m X 1 m

## The Process

Here's a visual walkthrough of the bed-making process:

## Purpose

This is just a temporary bed, and it's designed to be easily disassembled and moved to a different location if needed.
