With all the leftover wood from different projects, I had accumulated a bunch of blanks that I decided to convert to knife blanks. To move forward with this, I ordered some nice blanks online, and using beautiful wood species like Cocobolo and Purple heart, I was fairly quickly able to have some great knife projects going.

## The Process

The process of creating these custom knives involved several steps:

1. **Selecting the Blanks**: I chose high-quality steel blanks suitable for kitchen and hand knives.
2. **Wood Selection**: I used exotic woods like Cocobolo and Purple heart for the handles, which not only look beautiful but also provide a comfortable grip.
3. **Shaping**: The wood was carefully shaped to fit the tang of the knife and to provide an ergonomic grip. Mostly using hand cutting and a band-sander
4. **Finishing**: Multiple layers of finish were applied to protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty. Later, a few layers of wood-wax was applied to the handles.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the knife-making process:
