## The Process

The construction process involved several stages, each requiring careful attention to detail:

1. **Wood Selection and Preparation**

   - Selected premium Cenizaro boards for the main structure
   - Chose Nazareno for decorative elements and trim
   - Milled all lumber to precise dimensions

2. **Joinery and Assembly**
   - Used traditional mortise and tenon joints for strength
   - Implemented dovetail joints for the drawer construction
   - Created precise dado cuts for the bottom panel
   - Assembled with hide glue for authenticity
