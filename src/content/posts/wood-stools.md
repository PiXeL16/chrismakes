After completing our kitchen remodel, we needed comfortable, durable stools for our new island. I decided to design and craft a set of stools from solid cenizaro wood. The goal was to create pieces that would complement the kitchen's aesthetic while showcasing the natural beauty of this remarkable hardwood.

## Design Considerations

When designing these stools, I focused on three primary elements:

1. **Comfort** - The seats are sculpted to fit the human form, with a gentle curve that provides comfortable seating even for extended periods
2. **Stability** - The legs are splayed at precise angles to ensure optimal stability while maintaining an elegant profile
3. **Beauty** - Each piece highlights the natural grain and color variations of the cenizaro wood

## The Process

### Material Selection

The project began with careful selection of cenizaro wood. This hardwood is known for its:

- Rich, warm color tones ranging from golden honey to deep amber
- Distinctive grain patterns that add visual interest
- Exceptional durability for high-use furniture
- Natural resistance to wear and tear

### Seat Construction

Each seat began as a solid block of cenizaro, carefully shaped to achieve the sculptural form:

1. Initial rough shape was cut using a bandsaw
2. The concave seat surface was created using angle grinders and specialized carving tools
3. Multiple rounds of hand-sanding ensured a smooth, splinter-free surface
4. Final sculpting details were added with hand tools

### Leg Construction

The legs were designed with both aesthetics and structural integrity in mind:

1. Each leg was carefully turned on a lathe to achieve the desired taper
2. Joinery was planned to maximize strength at critical stress points
3. Mortise and tenon joints connect the legs to the seat
4. Additional reinforcement blocks ensure decades of stability

### Finishing

To enhance and protect the natural beauty of the cenizaro wood:

1. Progressive sanding from 80 to 320 grit
2. Applied three coats of food-safe oil finish
3. Light sanding between coats with 400 grit
4. Final buffing with carnauba wax for a satin sheen

## Technical Specifications

- **Height**: 75 cm (standard counter height)
- **Seat Dimensions**: 38 cm diameter
- **Weight**: Approximately 5 kg per stool
- **Finish**: Food-safe tung oil with carnauba wax topcoat
- **Joinery**: Traditional mortise and tenon with reinforcement blocks

## Lessons Learned

1. **Grain Direction Matters**: Aligning the grain correctly in the seat was crucial for both strength and appearance
2. **Template Value**: Creating a full-scale template ensured consistency across multiple stools
3. **Patience in Finishing**: Multiple thin coats of finish yielded far better results than fewer thick coats
4. **Ergonomic Testing**: Multiple design iterations were necessary to achieve the right balance of comfort and aesthetics

These stools have become not just functional seating options but conversation pieces that highlight the beauty of natural materials and traditional craftsmanship. They've proven durable enough for daily use while maintaining their beauty, demonstrating that well-crafted hardwood furniture is truly an investment in the future.
