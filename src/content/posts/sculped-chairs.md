These sculpted chairs started with the idea of using some really nice hardwood and sculpted seats, while also integrating a woven rest pattern. Between me and my mom (also a wood sculpturist) we designed and modeled the chairs. We used Purple Heart and Cenizaro as our wood of choice.
This was a long process, chairs are hard to make and design, keeping confort, practicallity and wood joinery in mind. From start to finish the project took more than 1 year, with several breaks in between.

## The Process

The process of creating these hardwood chairs involved several steps:

1. **Design Phase**: Working together with my mom, we created detailed designs that would combine comfort with aesthetic appeal.
2. **Wood Selection**: We carefully selected Purple Heart and Cenizaro wood for their durability and beautiful grain patterns.
3. **Sculpting**: The seats were hand-sculpted to ensure ergonomic comfort.
4. **Weaving**: The backrest was carefully woven to provide both support and visual interest.
5. **Finishing**: Multiple rounds of finishing were applied to protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the chair-making process:

## Materials Used

- Purple Heart wood
- Cenizaro wood

Creating these sculpted chairs was a special project that combined traditional woodworking skills with artistic design. The collaboration with my mom added an extra layer of meaning to the project, making it not just about creating furniture, but also about sharing knowledge and creativity across generations.
