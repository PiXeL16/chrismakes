A dream project of mine has been to have a desk with a view. After finishing the first floor of the house the perfect window was waiting for the desk. The desk was designed considering the measurements of the space and the ambiance I wanted to create. I aimed to maximize both functionality and aesthetics, ensuring the desk would be a perfect complement to the view it faced.

The design process involved selecting materials that not only matched the interior of the room but also reflected the natural scenery outside. I opted for a rich piece of Cenizaro wood that harmonized with the greenery, creating a seamless transition from indoor to outdoor.

Overall, the desk is not just a piece of furniture, but a place of inspirationâ€”a personal sanctuary where work meets relaxation, framed by the scenic beauty outside the window.

## The Process

The process of creating this slab desk involved several steps:

1. **Wood Selection**: Carefully chose a beautiful piece of Cenizaro wood for its grain pattern and durability.
2. **Design**: Created a design that would complement both the space and the view.
3. **Slab Preparation**: Prepared and flattened the wood slab to create the perfect work surface.
4. **Metal Work**: Build and installed metal legs that provide stability while maintaining a clean aesthetic.
5. **Finishing**: Applied multiple coats of finish to protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the desk-making process:
