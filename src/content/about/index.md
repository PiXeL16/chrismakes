This website was born from my desire to share all my pet and side projects, forcing me to put more of myself "out there". Over the years, I’ve gathered a diverse set of interests and some skills across various creative fields, including software development, woodworking, electronics, and design.

I love staying busy and creating something, hopefully, every day. Through this site, I aim to document my progress, share insights, and maybe even inspire others to dive into their own creative and technical pursuits. Whether you’re a fellow developer, a curious learner, or someone seeking inspiration or keeping themselves busy.

I hope you’ll find something engaging here. Feel free to explore my projects, learn from my experiences and failures, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or just want to connect!
