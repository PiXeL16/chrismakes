With all the leftover wood from different projects, I had accumulated a bunch of hardwood pieces that I decided to convert into cutting boards. Using beautiful wood species like Walnut, Maple, and Purple Hearth, Iron Wood, Oak, etc. I was able to create some great looking and functional cutting boards.

## The Process

The process of creating these hardwood cutting boards involved several steps:

1. **Wood Selection**: I chose a mix of hardwoods for their durability, beauty, and food-safe properties.
2. **Design**: Each board was designed to showcase the natural beauty of the wood grain and create interesting patterns.
3. **Cutting and Gluing**: The wood pieces were cut to size and carefully glued together to create the desired pattern.
4. **Sanding**: Multiple rounds of sanding were done to achieve a smooth, splinter-free surface.
5. **Finishing**: Food-safe oil was applied to protect the wood and enhance its natural colors.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the cutting board making process:
