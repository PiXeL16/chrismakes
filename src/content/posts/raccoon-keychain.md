Our nightly backyard visitors, a family of curious raccoons, inspired this fun little project. What started as regular encounters with these masked bandits turned into a creative collaboration: a 3D printed keychain hand-painted by my wife.

## The Inspiration

It started with occasional nighttime visits from a family of raccoons. These clever creatures would often peek through our windows, their masked faces and curious eyes becoming a familiar sight. Their charming (if sometimes mischievous) presence inspired us to create something that would capture their personality.

## The Process

### 3D Printing

- Printed in-place with no assembly required
- Used PLA filament at 0.12mm layer height
- Print time: approximately 1.5 hours
- Integrated keyring loop in the design

### Painting

My wife brought the raccoon to life through careful hand-painting:

- Primed with fine white primer
- Base coat of gray for the body
- Detailed black mask and rings on tail
- White highlights for face and chest
- Clear coat for protection

## Technical Details

- **Print Settings**

  - Layer Height: 0.12mm
  - Infill: 100% for durability
  - Temperature: 200Â°C
  - Print Speed: 40mm/s
  - Supports: None needed
  - Material: PLA

- **Paint Used**
  - Acrylic primer
  - Acrylic craft paints
  - Clear protective coating

## Lessons Learned

1. Print orientation matters for in-place joints
2. Light sanding before painting improves paint adhesion
3. Multiple thin coats work better than one thick coat
4. Clear coat helps protect the paint from daily wear

This small project combines modern 3D printing technology with traditional hand-painting techniques. The result is a unique, personalized keychain that serves as a daily reminder of our nocturnal neighbors. It's amazing how a simple encounter with local wildlife can spark creativity and lead to a fun family project.
