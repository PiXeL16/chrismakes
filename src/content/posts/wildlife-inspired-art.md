As part of my interest in Costa Rican wildlife, particularly endemic birds, I started creating a series of digital illustrations. These designs combine my love for nature with digital art techniques, focusing on capturing the unique characteristics of each species. The style is based losely on the illustration style of Charley Harper.

## The Process

The process of creating these wildlife-inspired designs involved several steps:

1. **Research**: Studying the endemic birds of Costa Rica, their characteristics, and habitats.
2. **Sketching**: Creating initial sketches to capture the essential features of each bird.
3. **Digital Drawing**: Converting sketches into digital format using iPad and Procreate.
4. **Color Selection**: Choosing colors that accurately represent each species while maintaining artistic appeal.
5. **Refinement**: Adding details and adjusting compositions for final presentation.

A few of the results:
