This trunk project started as a way to store some blankets and pillows in the bedroom. I wanted to create something that would be both functional and beautiful, using a combination of hardwoods.

## The Process

The process of creating this hardwood trunk involved several steps:

1. **Design Phase**: Started with sketches and plans to determine the size and proportions that would work best for the space.
2. **Wood Selection**: Chose a combination of hardwoods for their durability and visual appeal.
3. **Construction**: Built the main structure ensuring strong joints and proper alignment.
4. **Finishing**: Applied multiple coats of finish to protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty.
