This small outdoor side table was designed to withstand the elements while providing a practical surface for drinks, books, and potted plants on the porch. By combining cenizaro and oak for the top with pine legs, I created a piece that balances durability, aesthetics, and cost.

## Design Considerations

When designing this table, I focused on:

1. **Weather Resistance** - The table needed to withstand humidity, occasional rain, and sun exposure
2. **Stability** - A solid base that wouldn't wobble on uneven porch surfaces
3. **Visual Appeal** - Combining contrasting wood tones for an eye-catching design
4. **Practicality** - The right height and surface area for everyday use

## Materials Selection

I carefully selected a combination of woods that would complement each other while serving different purposes:

- **Cenizaro**: Used for the primary tabletop surface due to its natural weather resistance and beautiful grain pattern
- **Oak**: Used for the border and accent pieces to create visual contrast with the cenizaro
- **Pine**: Used for the legs to reduce weight and cost while providing adequate strength

## The Build Process

### Tabletop Construction

1. Milled the cenizaro planks to 2cm thickness
2. Cut oak strips for the border and accent pieces
3. Created a simple but elegant pattern of alternating woods
4. Glued all pieces using waterproof wood glue
5. Clamped overnight for a strong bond
6. Sanded progressively from 80 to 220 grit

### Leg Construction

1. Cut pine 4x4s to 45cm length for the four legs
2. Tapered the legs slightly for visual appeal
3. Added a subtle chamfer to the bottom to prevent splintering
4. Attached cross-braces for additional stability
5. Sanded to 180 grit for a smooth finish

### Finish Application

To protect the table from the elements:

1. Applied a coat of wood conditioner to ensure even absorption
2. Used three coats of marine-grade polyurethane for maximum weather protection
3. Lightly sanded between coats with 320 grit
4. Added rubber feet to the bottom of each leg for stability
5. Applied a final coat of UV-resistant sealant

## Technical Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 60cm x 60cm x 50cm (height)
- **Tabletop Thickness**: 2.5cm
- **Leg Thickness**: 7cm x 7cm
- **Weight**: Approximately 8kg
- **Finish**: Marine-grade polyurethane with UV protection

## Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates that you don't need expensive exotic hardwoods throughout to create a beautiful and functional outdoor piece. By strategically combining cenizaro and oak for the visible surfaces with pine for the structural elements, I created a table that's both beautiful and practical.

After several months on the porch, the table has weathered beautifully, developing a subtle patina while maintaining its structural integrity. The marine-grade finish has protected against rain and humidity, while the UV protection has prevented excessive fading.

This small side table has become an indispensable part of our outdoor living space - perfect for morning coffee, afternoon reading, or evening drinks while enjoying the sunset.
