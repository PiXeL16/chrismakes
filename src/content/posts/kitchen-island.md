This kitchen island project was designed to provide additional counter space and storage while complementing the existing kitchen design. The island features a solid wood top made with beautiful cenizaro and cocobolo wood, multiple storage drawers, and a clean, modern aesthetic.

## The Process

The process of creating this kitchen island involved several steps:

1. **Design**: Created detailed plans considering both functionality and aesthetics.
2. **Material Selection**: Chose durable materials suitable for kitchen use.
3. **Construction**: Built the base structure and storage components.
4. **Assembly**: Carefully assembled all components ensuring proper alignment.
5. **Finishing**: Applied food-safe finishes for protection and beauty.

A cutlist was generated from the original plans, and all the cuts were based on those initial designs.
