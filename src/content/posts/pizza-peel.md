After getting into pizza making, I realized I needed a proper pizza peel. Instead of buying one, I decided to make my own using some beautiful hardwood pieces I had in the workshop. The project combines Cenizaro for the paddle and Rosewood for accents, creating not just a functional tool but also a beautiful piece of kitchen equipment.

## The Process

The process of creating this pizza peel involved several key steps:

1. **Design**: Created a design that would be both functional and beautiful, with proper dimensions for handling pizzas
2. **Wood Selection**: Chose Cenizaro for its durability and food-safe properties, with Rosewood accents for visual appeal
3. **Shaping**: Carefully shaped the paddle to be thin enough for sliding under pizzas while maintaining strength
4. **Handle Construction**: Created an ergonomic handle design for comfortable use
5. **Finishing**: Applied food-safe finish to protect the wood and make it suitable for kitchen use

Here's a visual walkthrough of the pizza peel construction process:

## Materials Used

- Cenizaro wood for the paddle
- Rosewood for decorative elements
- Food-safe wood glue
- Multiple grits of sandpaper
- Food-safe finish and mineral oil

## Purpose

This pizza peel serves both as a functional kitchen tool and a piece of handcrafted kitchen art. Its long handle provides safe distance from the hot oven, while the thin paddle edge makes it easy to slide under pizzas. The combination of hardwoods not only looks beautiful but also ensures durability for years of use.
