In 2022, I became the happy owner of a Piano. The bench that it came with was not really cutting it, so I decided to make a new one. Luckily I have access to beautiful wood, and used Purple-Heart for the top of the bench.

## The Process

The process began with careful planning and design. I wanted to create a bench that was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, complementing the piano and the room.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the bench-making process:

## Materials Used

- Purple-Heart wood for the top of the bench
- Oak inlays for accents
- Pine for the base structure
- Polyurethane finish for protection and shine
