This small desk features a minimalist design with clean lines, ideal for tight spaces. It's approximately 120 cm long, 70 cm wide, and 75 cm tall.

## The Process

The initial rough design was put together in Fusion360, from which everything was split into cuts and parts.

## Materials Used

- Guanacaste (Costa Rica National Tree) was used for the top.
- Pine for the base, that was later painted black
- Polyurethane finish for protection

## Purpose

The desk provides a great reading and working place next to the window. It can also be easily dis-assembly and moved to a different location.
