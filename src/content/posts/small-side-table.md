I designed and built this small side table to serve a specific purpose in our home entry - a dedicated spot next to the door to hold everyday essentials like keys, mail, and other miscellaneous items. The project gave me the opportunity to work with some exceptional hardwoods, including Purple Heart and Rosewood, creating not just a functional piece but also a striking accent piece for our entryway.

The table's design prioritizes both form and function, with a surface height perfect for quick access while maintaining an elegant profile that complements its location next to the desk.

2. **Wood Selection**: Carefully chose Purple Heart and Rosewood for their beauty and durability
3. **Construction**: Precision cutting and joinery to showcase the beautiful wood grain
4. **Assembly**: Carefully assembled the pieces ensuring perfect alignment
5. **Finishing**: Applied finish to protect and enhance the natural beauty of the exotic woods
