Two small side tables using different hardwoods like Cocobolo, Oak, Purple Heart. I used checker patterns, similar to the treatment that you would give cutting boards, but also integrated wood bending as part of the patterns.

## The Process

The process of creating these pattern side tables involved several steps:

1. **Wood Selection**: I chose a mix of hardwoods including Cocobolo, Oak, and Purple Heart for their contrasting colors and durability.
2. **Pattern Design**: Each table was designed to showcase intricate checker patterns while incorporating bent wood elements.
3. **Wood Bending**: The wood was cut into thin strips and then steamed and bent wood pieces were integrated into the design.
4. **Assembly**: The patterns were assemble and a support structure was added to the table.
5. **Finishing**: Multiple rounds of finishing were applied to protect the wood and enhance the natural colors.

Here's a visual walkthrough of the side table making process:
