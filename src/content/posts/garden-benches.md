Together with my dad, working from two different continents, we designed, built, painted, and assembled a pair of garden benches. The project was a unique collaboration that bridged the distance between us, combining our shared love of woodworking with modern technology to coordinate our efforts.

The benches were designed to be both sturdy and elegant, with classic styling that would complement any outdoor space. We chose weather-resistant materials and finishes to ensure they would stand up to the elements for years to come.

## The Process

The process of creating these garden benches involved several steps:

1. **Design**: Created detailed plans considering both aesthetics and durability for outdoor use
2. **Material Selection**: Chose weather-resistant woods and hardware suitable for outdoor furniture
3. **Construction**: Built the components following the agreed-upon design
4. **Assembly**: Carefully assembled all pieces ensuring proper alignment and stability
5. **Finishing**: Applied weather-resistant finishes for protection against the elements
