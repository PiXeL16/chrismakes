This project combines traditional woodworking with modern technology to create a unique moon lamp. The base is crafted from beautiful Cocobolo wood, while the moon itself is 3D printed using a detailed lunar surface model. The electronics are custom-built to provide smooth dimming and color temperature control.

## The Components

### The Base

The Cocobolo base was carefully selected for its rich, dark colors and beautiful grain patterns. This exotic hardwood provides a stunning contrast to the ethereal glow of the moon above. The base houses all the electronics and provides a stable foundation for the lamp.

### The Moon

The moon sphere was 3D printed in layers using translucent PLA, with detailed surface features based on NASA's lunar topology data. The printing process took approximately 15 hours to complete at 0.12mm layer height for maximum detail.

### The Electronics

- Arduino Nano for control
- PWM LED driver for smooth dimming
- Warm and cool white LEDs for adjustable color temperature
- Touch-sensitive control pad integrated into the wood base
- Custom PCB for clean wire management

## The Process

Here's how the project came together:

## Build Details

1. **Base Construction**

   - Turned the Cocobolo blank on a lathe
   - Created a hollow chamber for electronics
   - Added channels for wire routing
   - Finished with multiple coats of oil

2. **3D Printing**

   - Sliced the moon model for optimal light diffusion
   - Printed in translucent PLA at 15% infill
   - Post-processed surface for smooth light distribution

3. **Electronics**
   - Designed custom PCB for component mounting
   - Programmed Arduino for smooth transitions
   - Implemented touch controls with capacitive sensing
   - Added thermal management considerations

## Features

- Smooth dimming from 0-100%
- Color temperature adjustment (2700K-6500K)
- Touch-sensitive controls
- Memory function for last used settings
- Automatic night mode
- USB-C powered

## Lessons Learned

1. Cocobolo dust can be an irritant - proper ventilation and dust collection are crucial
2. Heat management is important for LED longevity
3. Wire routing needs to be planned before wood turning
4. Testing electronics before final assembly saves headaches

This project represents a perfect blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology. The warm glow of the moon against the rich Cocobolo base creates a mesmerizing display that serves both as functional lighting and artistic decoration.
